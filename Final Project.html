	<h1>Alphea </h1>
	<h2>Dimension of Magic</h2>
	<h3>The Savior of Alphea or its Destruction?</h3>
	<p>For this project I chose animation shorts, when I was creating, I used photoshop for places like the dimension of magic and the mortal world, illustrator for my character and audacity for the audio to give a bit of tension. I wanted to demonstrate everything that I described in my character biography, starting with the kingdom of Alphea and ending with the mortal world where Artemis fights the creatures of darkness to protect humans. From the beginning, I placed my character without knowing how to control her magic,avoiding who she really is, feeling different from the others, just as I shared her words in the audio project. For this final project, I wanted you to see what her true nature is like as well as doing what she likes, which is going to the human world, helping mortals and practicing her powers with enemies. I called this project “The Savior of Alphea or its Destruction” because I wanted to do something dramatic, Artemis is an extremely powerful character who doesn't know if she is the hero or the villain of this story, we only have the doubt. So what do you think Artemis is the Savior or the Destruction of Alphea?</p>
