	<h3>Into the Woods</h3>
	<p>When everybody is sleeping and the Moon starts to come out, Artemis likes to go into the woods and practice her magic. When Artemis uses the light magic, her hands light up, she can make an aura to protect her, light spheres to illuminate or make a light whips to fight. Though, the problem of the Moon’s linage is they have a dark magic and Artemis can’t control as the only Moon’s daughter, so when she try to use it, the environment feels cold and thick, it start to appear shadows by her hands, but she feel the magic consumes and take control of her. Artemis has a war with herself. And unfortunately, she is alone in this world. </p>
